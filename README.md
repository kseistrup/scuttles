## ssbvan

A vanity address generator for `sbot`. Let's say you're gonna run a
pub and you want its public address to begin with the letters PUB:

```sh
$ ssbvan pub
# This is your SECRET name.
# This name gives you magical powers.
# With it you can mark your messages so that your friends can verify
# that they really did come from you.
#
# If any one learns this name, they can use it to destroy your identity.
# NEVER show this to anyone!

  "curve": "ed25519",
  "id": "@PUBcjocUqNPuvFa5NTNy4tx5bzUJC4Tuk0mpjhWTQQY=.ed25519",
  "private": "F0xuLYUQ1E5+qez2+ex1203qOWX5U0U0dfxewOevizU9QFyOhxSo0+68Vrk1M3Li3HlvNQkLhO6TSamOFZNBBg==.ed25519",
  "public": "PUBcjocUqNPuvFa5NTNy4tx5bzUJC4Tuk0mpjhWTQQY=.ed25519"
}

# WARNING: It's vital that you DO NOT edit OR share your secret name
# instead, share your public name.
# Your public name: @PUBcjocUqNPuvFa5NTNy4tx5bzUJC4Tuk0mpjhWTQQY=.ed25519
$
```

If you

```sh
$ ssbvan something | tee secret
```

you will find a complete `secret` file for your `~/.ssb` directory.

Try `ssbvan --help` for more information.

## secexp / secimp

Export resp. import an SSB ‘secret’ file.

When exporting a key, only the part essential for restoring the original
key is exported — either in a long form (the default) or a shorter form.
Both formats are suitable for use with e.g. the
[ssss](http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/ "Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme")
util but the shorter form is approximately half the size of the full key:

```sh
$ secexp < test/secret
ySzrVzivOW7gmiOC3GEnBJcsFc7B0OlFF6CgxPLaA6y+ggNiwZHQh18mED7A13uclLaxBdOovmECp7UEvD/e1A==
$ secexp --private-only < test/secret
ySzrVzivOW7gmiOC3GEnBJcsFc7B0OlFF6CgxPLaA6w=
$ secexp --private-only < test/secret | secimp -j
{
  "curve": "ed25519",
  "id": "@voIDYsGR0IdfJhA+wNd7nJS2sQXTqL5hAqe1BLw/3tQ=.ed25519",
  "private": "ySzrVzivOW7gmiOC3GEnBJcsFc7B0OlFF6CgxPLaA6y+ggNiwZHQh18mED7A13uclLaxBdOovmECp7UEvD/e1A==.ed25519",
  "public": "voIDYsGR0IdfJhA+wNd7nJS2sQXTqL5hAqe1BLw/3tQ=.ed25519"
}
```

### Requirements

* Python 3
  * pynacl module (‘pip install pynacl’)

:smile:

* If you haven't used yet pip for python3, you need to do the following, e.g. on Ubuntu:
  * apt-get install python3-pip
  * pip3 install pynacl
